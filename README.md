The leader will also be in charge of accepting commits to the Master branch. Please put it to a vote in Github.

## Getting Started

Fork this repository and get started.

### Prerequisites

To work on the website from your local machine, be sure you have a Versioning System installed preferably [Git](https://git-scm.com/). Also, you should have experience of Web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), a Text Editor/Web IDE, and a recent version of any popular web browser.

Clone the forked repository from GitHub.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/UoPeopleSDS.github.io

Navigate into the cloned repository.
```
$ cd project
```
Create a new branch.
```
$ git branch yourusername-patch-patchnumber
```
Switch to your new branch.
```
$ git checkout yourusername-patch-patchnumber
```
Make the changes you want on your new branch and when you are done, you can verify the changes using `git status`.

To commit your changes,
first stage the files for commit.
```
$ git add <filename1> <filename2>
```
Verify that the files have been staged.
```
$ git status
```
Then make your commit.
```
$ git commit -m 'commit message'
```
To merge your modifications from the development branch, first switch to the `master` branch.
```
$ git checkout master
```
Merge the development branch with the `master` branch.
```
